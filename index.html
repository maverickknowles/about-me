    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Maverick Knowles</h2>
    <div class="about-me">
        <p>Growing up in South Central, PA, I was always on the lookout for new experiences and opportunities to learn. That quest led me to Peru, where I spent 8 months as a scholarship recipient, soaking in new cultures and perfecting my Spanish language skills. It was an eye-opening experience that has stayed with me to this day.
        </p>
        <p>Building on that foundation, I attended Coastal Carolina University, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BSBA in Business Management in record time. I was a dedicated student-athlete, thriving as a member of the CCU Club Soccer and Volleyball Teams, and earning recognition for my academic achievements through multiple President's List and Dean's List honors.
        </p>
        <p>With a keen interest in the future of technology, I am eager to dive into the industry and explore the possibilities it holds. The concept of decentralization, in particular, has captured my imagination and I am eager to learn more about how it can shape the world. I am confident that my drive to learn and improve, combined with my skills and experience, will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to this field.
        </p>
  <p>As a multilingual individual, fluent in Spanish and competent in Italian, I bring a unique set of skills to the table. My strong mathematical background and computer proficiency give me the versatility to tackle any challenge that comes my way.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not focusing on my professional pursuits, I'm an adrenaline junkie who lives for excitement. Snowboarding, table tennis, soccer, and chess are just a few of my favorite pastimes, and I relish the opportunity to put my problem-solving skills to the test in a collaborative setting.
        </p>
       <p>In short, I am a driven individual with a passion for innovation, a love for learning, and a commitment to success. With my unique blend of skills and experiences, I am poised to make a positive impact on the world.
