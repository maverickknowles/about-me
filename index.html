    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Maverick Knowles...</h2>

    <div class="about-me">
        <p>Growing up in South Central, PA, I was always on the 
            lookout for new experiences and opportunities to learn.
             That quest led me to Peru, where I spent 8 months as a
              scholarship recipient, soaking in new cultures 
              and perfecting my Spanish language skills. It was an 
              eye-opening experience that has stayed with me to this 
              day.
        </p>
        <p>Building on that foundation, I attended Coastal Carolina
             University, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude with
              a BSBA in Business Management in record time. I was a
               dedicated student-athlete, thriving as a member
                of the CCU Club Soccer and Volleyball Teams, and 
                earning recognition for my academic achievements 
                through multiple President's List and Dean's List
                 honors.
        </p>
        <p>With a keen interest in the future of technology, I am 
            eager to dive into the industry and explore the
             possibilities it holds. The concept of decentralization,
              in particular, has captured my imagination 
              and I am eager to learn more about how it can shape
               the world. I am confident that my drive to learn and
                improve, combined with my skills and experience, 
                will enable me to make a meaningful contribution 
                to this field.
        </p>
  <p>As a multilingual individual, fluent in 
    Spanish and competent in Italian,
     I bring a unique set of skills to the table. My strong
      mathematical background and computer proficiency give me the
       versatility to tackle any challenge that comes my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also someone who is passionate about exploring 
            the world; stepping out of my comfort zone any 
            chance that I am given. 
             I believe traveling to new places allows me to 
             broaden my horizons, learn about different cultures, 
             and gain new perspectives. Whether it be through trying 
             new foods, immersing myself in the local atmosphere, 
             or taking on new experiences, I am always eager to challenge
              myself and grow as a person. My love for adventure and
             excitement makes travel a top priority in my life. 
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not traveling, I am probably writing, learning,
            working or working on something new. Otherwise you can find
             me playing table tennis, soccer, or chess. I always 
             relish the opportunity
             to put my problem-solving skills to the test in a 
             collaborative setting.
        </p>
       <p>In short, I am a driven individual with a passion
         for innovation, a love for learning, a drive for travel, and a commitment 
         to success. With my unique blend of skills and experiences,
          I am destined to make a grand impact on the world.
